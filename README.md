## SORTING ALGORITHMS VISUALIZER
I wanted to learn more about algorithms and i realized visualization helped me to understand better.
Than i decided to make this project to learn more about algorithms.

You can check it out from here [https://mtzngn.github.io/sorting-algorithms-visualizer/]
If you want to run it locally;
First install the dependencies by running the following command in project directory:
### `npm install`
Than you can styart the app with following command:
### `npm start`


### Information About Algorithms Used
***
#### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
#### Merge Sort
It is basically a divide and conquer algorithm.  It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
#### Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
#### Insertion Sort
nsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
